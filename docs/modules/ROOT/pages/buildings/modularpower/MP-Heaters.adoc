= Modular Power Heaters

## Building Information:
Heaters are used to burn fuel to make heat, currently there is 4 variants of heaters. Biomass, Coal, Solution & Nuclear.

Once the heater reaches 100c the attached Boiler will then start producing Steam, the temperature will reach 1024c for the nuclear heater and 500c for the rest.

The heater will produce Co2 which will need to be handled wither by venting through a chimney or turned into Carbon Dust, if the Co2 is not resolved and fills the heater, it will stop producing heat and slowly cool.

## Building Usage Rates:
|===
| Building Name   | Item Tested       | Consumption | Production

| Biomass Heater  | Soild Biofuel     | ~36/Min     | ~48/Min    

| Coal Heater     | Coal              | ~20/Min     | ~75/Min    

| Solution Heater | Fuel              | ~14/Min     | ~98/Min    

| Nuclear Heater  | Nuclear Fuel Rods | ~0.5/Min    | ~10/Min
